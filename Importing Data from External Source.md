### **Google Sheets**
In Google Sheets, you can use the IMPORTRANGE function. It enables you to specify a range of cells in the other spreadsheet to duplicate in the spreadsheet you are working in. You must allow access to the spreadsheet containing the data the first time you import the data.
Refer to the Google Help Center's [IMPORTRANGE](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093340?hl=en&ref_topic=9199554 "IMPORTRANGE") page for more information about the syntax. There is also an example of its use later in the program in [Advanced functions for speedy data cleaning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data/supplement/PLnRS/advanced-functions-for-speedy-data-cleaning).

## Importing data from CSV files

### **Google Sheets**
**Step 1:** Open the **File** menu in your spreadsheet and select **Import** to open the Import file window.
**Step 2:** Select **Upload** and then select the CSV file you want to import.
**Step 3:** From here, you will have a few options. For **Import location**, you can choose to replace the current spreadsheet, create a new spreadsheet, insert the CSV data as a new sheet, add the data to the current spreadsheet, or replace the data in a specific cell. The data will be inserted as plain text only if you _uncheck_ the Convert text to numbers, dates, and formulas checkbox, which is the default setting. Sometimes a CSV file uses a separator like a semi-colon or even a blank space instead of a comma. For **Separator type**, you can select Tab or Comma, or select Custom to enter another character that is being used as the separator.
**Step 4:** Select **Import data**. The data in the CSV file will be loaded into your sheet, and you can begin using it!
**Note:** You can also use the **IMPORTDATA** function in a spreadsheet cell to import data using the URL to a CSV file. Refer to Google Help Center's [IMPORTDATA](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093335?hl=en "IMPORTDATA") page for more information and the syntax.

**Step 5:** In most cases, accept the default settings in the previous step and click **Load** to load the data in the CSV file to the spreadsheet.Â The data in the CSV file will be loaded into the spreadsheet, and you can begin working with the data.

Importing HTML tables is a very basic method to extract or "scrape" data from public web pages. [Web scraping made easy](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/anna-prosvetova/web-scraping-made-easy-import-html-tables-or-lists-using-google-sheets-and-excel "Web scraping made easy") introduces how to do this with Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

### **Google Sheets**
In Google Sheets, you can use the **IMPORTHTML** function. It enables you to import the data from an HTML table (or list) on a web page.

It is like a pointer indicating which table on the page you want to import the data from.
