Types of Graphics
	[Types of charts and graphs in Google Sheets:](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190718?hl=en "Types of charts and graphs in google sheets")
	[Excel Charts](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/excel_charts/excel_charts_types.htm "excel charts")
	--------See PDF for "How to Choose a Data Viz"
	Line Chart - used to track changes over short and long periods of time.
		When smaller changes exist, line charts are better to use than bar graphs.
	Column Charts - use size to contrast and compare two or more values, using height or lengths to represent the specific values.
	Heatmaps - use color to compare categories in a data set.
		Mainly used to show relationships between two variables and use a system of color-coding to represent different values.
	Pie Chart - a circular graph that is divided into segments representing proportions corresponding to the quantity it represents, especially when dealing with parts of a whole.
	Scatterplot - shows relationships between different variables.
		Typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed.
	Distribution Graph - displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.
		Histogram - Outcomes are categorized on the x-axis by distinct numeric values (or ranges of numeric values).
Meaningful Patterns
	**Change:** This is a trend or instance of observations that become different over time. A great way to measure change in data is through a line or column chart.
    **Clustering:** A collection of data points with similar or different values. This is best represented through a distribution graph.
    **Relativity:** These are observations considered in relation or in proportion to something else. You have probably seen examples of relativity data in a pie chart.
    **Ranking:** This is a position in a scale of achievement or status. Data that requires ranking is best represented by a column chart.
    **Correlation:** This shows a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A scatterplot is an excellent way to represent this type of data pattern.

Ways to make data visualizations accessible:
	[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh's accessibility guidelines](http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/)
	1. Labeling - label data directly instead of relying on legends.
	2. Text alternatives - defining your labels through text.
	3. Text-based format - make data from charts and diagrams available in a text-based format through an export to Sheets or Excel.
	4. Distinguishing - Use textures and shapes instead of color
			1. Make it easier for people to see and hear content by separating foreground from background. 
			1. Using bright colors, that contrast against the background can help those with poor visibility, whether permanently or temporarily clearly see the information conveyed. 
			2. Another option is to avoid relying solely on color to convey information, and instead distinguished with different textures and shapes.
			3. -   [Web Accessibility Guidelines, Contrast & Color](http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/ "Web Accessibility Guidelines, Contrast and Color")
	5. Simplify - Do not overcomplicate visualizations
