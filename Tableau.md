Which Chart or Graph to use?
	[Which chart or graph is right for you?](http://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/media/which_chart_v6_final_0.pdf "Which chart or graph is right for you?")
	[The Ultimate Cheat Sheet on Tableau Charts](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-on-tableau-charts-642bca94dde5 "The ultimate cheat sheet on tableau charts")

Specialized Visualizations:
	-   **Highlight tables** appear like tables with conditional formatting. Review the [steps to build a highlight table](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm "steps to build a highlight table"). 
	-   **Heat maps** show intensity or concentrations in the data. Review the [steps to build a heat map](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm "steps to build a heat map").
	-   **Density maps** show concentrations (like a population density map). Refer to [instructions to create a heat map for density](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_howto_heatmap.htm "instructions to create a heat map for density").  
	-   **Gantt charts** show the duration of events or activities on a timeline. Review the [steps to build a Gantt chart](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_gantt.htm "steps to build a Gantt chart").
	-   **Symbol maps** display a mark over a given longitude and latitude. Learn more from this [example of a symbol map](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/08/18/tableau-essentials-chart-types-symbol-map/ "example of a symbol map").
	-   **Filled maps** are maps with areas colored based on a measurement or dimension. Explore an [example of a filled map](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/09/23/tableau-essentials-chart-types-filled-map/ "example of a filled map").
	-   **Circle views** show comparative strength in data. Learn more from this [example of a circle view](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/10/17/tableau-essentials-chart-types-circle-view/ "example of a circle view").
	-   **Box plots** also known as **box-and whiskers charts** show the distribution of values along a chart axis. Refer to the [steps to build a box plot](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_boxplot.htm "steps to build a box plot").
	-   **Bullet graphs** compare a primary measure with another and can be used instead of dial gauge charts. Review the [steps to build a bullet graph](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/qs_bullet_graphs.htm "steps to build a bullet graph").
	-   **Packed bubble charts** display data in clustered circles. Review the [steps to build a packed bubble chart](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_bubbles.htm "steps to build a packed bubble chart").

	Resources
		[**Set up data sources**](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_prepare.htm "set up data sources")
			his page links to other resources explaining how to **set up your data sources** and prepare them for analysis once you have connected them to your Tableau account. It specifically includes articles explaining how to join or blend data, and what a union is and how they work. This is a great starting point as you get ready to begin using and combining data sources.
		[**Join your data**](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/joining_tables.htm "join your data")
			**Joining** refers to the process of combining data sources based on common fields. This article gives a more detailed explanation of the different joins, how to use them in Tableau, and an example join with a step-by-step guide.
		[**Don’t be scared of relationships**](https://help.tableau.com/v2020.2/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_dont_be_scared.htm "Don't be scared of relationships")
			**Relationships** allow you to combine multiple data sources in Tableau. This is a more flexible alternative to joins, and doesn’t force you to create one single table with your multiple data sources. This article will give you more insight into how relationships work.
		[**How relationships differ from joins**](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/datasource_relationships_learnmorepage.htm "how relationships differ from joins")
			This article goes into more detail about the differences between using **relationships and joins**, and guides you through the process of using relationships to combine data.
		[**Blend your data**](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiple_connections.htm "blend your data")
			**Data blending** is another method you can use to combine multiple data sources. Instead of truly combining the data, blends allow you to query and aggregate data from multiple sources. This resource goes into more detail about blending and includes a tutorial.
		[**Combining multiple date fields**](https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/combining-start-and-end-dates-into-a-single-axis "combining multiple date fields")
			This resource provides examples that explain how to **combine date fields** when using four different methods of data combination in Tableau.
