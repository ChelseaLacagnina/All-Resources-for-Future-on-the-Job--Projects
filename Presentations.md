Consider the following best practices for slide decks:
	-   Include a title, subtitle, and date
	-   Use a logical sequence of slides
	-   Provide an agenda with a timeline
	-   Limit the amount of text on slides. Your audience should be able to scan each block of text on your slides within 5 seconds
	-   Start with the business task. Focus on the business task and frame the information in the context of the business task.
	-   Establish the initial hypothesis
	-   Show what business metrics you used
	-   Use visualizations
	-   Introduce the graphic by name
	-   Provide a title for each graph
	-   Go from the general to the specific
	-   Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points
	-   Include key takeaways

Good Data Presentation
	-   Title and date the presentation was last updated
	-   Flow or table of contents
	-   Transition slides 
	-   Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme)
	-   Animated bullet points
	-   Annotations on top of visuals
	-   Logic and progression 
	-   Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data can’t tell you

Tips
	1. Channel your excitement
	2. Start with the broader ideas
	3. Use the five second rule when showing visualizations
		1. Wait five seconds after showing a data visualization
		2. Ask if they understand it
		3. Give your audience another five seconds
		4. Tell them the conclusion that you want them to understand
	4. Preparation is key
	5. Your audience won't always get what you are saying
		1. Answer things clearly and simply
	6. Be mindful of nervous habits

Q & A
	Predicting Questions Beforehand
		1. Have a clear understanding your stakeholder's expectations and project goals
		2. The colleague test - see what questions they ask in a practice run
		3. Start with zero assumptions of knowledge
			1. Don't assume that your audience is already familiar with jargon, acronyms, past events, or other necessary background information
		4. Work with a team to anticipate questions and draft responses
		5. Be prepared to consider limitations
			1. Critically analyze correlations
			2. Look at the context
			3. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of the tools used
	Before the presentation
		1.  Assemble and prepare your questions.
		2.  Discuss your presentation with your manager, other analysts, or other friendly contacts in your organization.
		3.  Ask a manager or other analysts what sort of questions were normally asked by your specific audience in the past.
		4.  Seek comments, feedback, and questions on the deck or the document of your analysis.
		5.  At least 24 hours ahead of the presentation, try and brainstorm tricky questions or unclear parts you may come across- this helps avoid surprises.
		6.  It never hurts to practice what you will be presenting, to account for any missing information or simply to calm your nerves.
	During the presentation
		1.  Be prepared to respond to the things that you find and effectively and accurately explain your findings.
		2.  Address potential questions that may come up.
		3.  Avoid having a single question derail a presentation and propose following-up offline.
		4.  Put supplementary visualizations and content in the appendix to help answer questions.

Handling Objections
	Types of Objections (Can add this info into an Appendix)
		About the Data
			Where you got the data?
			What systems it came from?
			What transformations happened to it before getting it?
			How fresh and accurate is the data?
		About the Analysis
			Is your analysis reproducible?
				Keep a Change Log for this to be possible
				Keep a clean version of your script.
			Who did you get feedback from during this process?
		About the Findings
			Do these findings exsit in previous time periods?
			Did you control for the differences in your data?
	Responding to Objections
		Communicate any assumptions 
			If your team cleaned the data.
		Explain why your analysis might be different than expected
		Acknowledge that objections are valid and take steps to investigate further.
		1. Listen to the whole question
		2. Repeat the question back so you understand the question
		3. Understand the context
		4. Involve the whole audience
		5. Explain your answer
			1. Keep your response short and to the point
			2. Stay focussed on the question itself
	Other Ways to Receive Feedback
		During the presentation
			Interactive activities (quizes), index cards (for audience to write down questions), Providing your contact information
		After the presentation
			Surveys, one-on-one interviews, or focus groups
